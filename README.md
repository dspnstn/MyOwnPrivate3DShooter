# MyOwnPrivate3DShooter
Project files for my Unity-based 3D game.
In this mixed-genre type game you got to fight the Enemy and then face fun and scary challenges on your way to freedom. Use WASD to move, Left Mouse click to shoot, Spacebar to jump and open doors, press E when offered to and use Esc for a Menu to appear.
